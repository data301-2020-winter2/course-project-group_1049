## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In this project, we hope to use the data to provide statistics for the game of chess. Riley is interested in the statistics of chess as it is often used in chess AI. Specifically, chess AI will use statistics provided to make decisions on its next move. We are curious in learning what can come out of this data. For example, we may be able to find out what openings lead to the shortest games. Another interesting topic is what openings are more commonly played by lower and higher-ranked individuals. We are also wondering if adding more data or using different data will strongly affect the results we get. When using personal game data, a user would have personalized statistics providing more helpful information to themselves. It would be fascinating to see if the data we find is consistent with games not recorded in this particular data set because chess is a very popular and complicated game. Because chess is so complex, the statistics we find will not be exact.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We currently have a chess data set(I am open to changing this if anyone asks, we are currently using this data set because no one has suggested an alternative). This data set was found on Kaggle and provides information on over 20000 chess games collected from a selection of users on the site Lichess.org. This data was provided in 2018 and again updated in 2019. The data includes Game ID; Rated (T/F); Start Time; End Time; Number of Turns; Victory Status; Winner; Time Increment; White Player ID; White Player Rating; Black Player ID; Black Player Rating; list of moves; Opening Eco; Opening Name; Opening Ply (Number of moves in the opening phase). This data, when organized, can provide information that could positively influence one's knowledge of chess. More specifically, this data can educate people in the strongest openings to play for white and black. For example, the data set can provide statistics for which first move to play. Because over 20000 games played by several users were recorded, this data set can provide some fairly accurate information.
